# Strings Imageboard App 🎉

## Tech Stack 💻

The Strings Imageboard App is a web application built using the following frameworks and libraries:

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment.
- **Express**: For efficient routing.
- **EJS**: Template Engine.
- **JSONWEBTOKEN**: For authentication and authorization.
- **Multer**: For seamless file uploading.
- **Cookie-Parser**: For managing cookie responses.
- **Mongoose**: For CRUD operations in MongoDB Collections.

### Frontend
- **Bootstrap (4.4.1)**: For frontend components.

### Database Management 🗃️
- **MongoDB**: For data storage of user usernames and passwords.

## Basic Idea 📚

Our web app is inspired by the concept of 4Chan, an imageboard discussion platform. While 4Chan may lack on the frontend, it compensates with rapid content sharing and a unique approach. We aim to create an imageboard and text-based community social platform for various college activities, eliminating the need for multiple apps and platforms for basic updates and information.

We introduce the concept of "Strings," representing specific spaces within the app, denoted by '~.' For instance, the "Technobyte" string would host imageboard discussions related to technology. Within each string, there are sub-spaces called THREADS. For example, the "Thread Main" would feature official messages from the admin, while custom threads allow non-admin users to send mesages .
